# Welcome to the Student Zone at Build 2020!

We are so excited to provide support for you to not only learn by listening and watching, but by doing! 
Explore this repository to find starter code for some of the projects and demos from the Student Zone!

## What is Build?
Build is Microsoft's professional developer conference where, you guessed it, professional developers come 
to confer!...By that we mean where developers come to learn about how Microsoft can better support their
unique developer journey. There are technical sessions, opportunities to meet and talk with experts, and 
the chance to discover and grow a technical community.

## What is the Student Zone?
Each year at Build we create a session track specifically aimed at student developers. The target age
for our student developers is 14-21 years old, though that is really just there to guide us in scoping 
the content we create for you! So if you're a bit outside of these exact ages, you still might find this content 
useful for your coding journey too!

## What other resources does Microsoft have for students?
### Microsoft Student Learn Ambassadors
Microsoft Student Learn Ambassadors are a global group of on-campus ambassadors who are eager to help fellow students, lead in their local tech community, and develop technical and career skills for the future. You might find yourself organizing a hackathon to solve the world’s toughest problems, mentoring fellow students, or unlocking the next great idea with your team — it’s all up to you.
Learn how to become a Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador [here](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/). 

### Imagine Cup
For nearly two decades, students from around the world have participated in Microsoft’s global technology competition, the Imagine Cup, to bring their unique tech solutions to life. But the Imagine Cup is more than just a competition—you can work with friends (and make new ones!), network with professionals, gain new skills, make a difference in the world around you, and have a chance to win travel, mentorship, and cash. Find out more about the Imagine Cup competition [here](http://imaginecup.com/).

### Imagine Cup Jr
Imagine Cup Junior 2020 is an opportunity for students aged 13 – 18 to learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and create an AI for Good concept that they think could make a positive impact on the world around them.  The top 3 teams (1 - 6 students per team) from each region will receive a Windows 10 device each, an Imagine Cup Junior trophy and a group mentoring session with a Microsoft Vice President.

Students can learn more about AI and build their projects live via our Imagine Cup Junior Teams events:
